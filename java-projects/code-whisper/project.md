🔥 Project Name: “CodeWhisperer - Context-Aware Voice Chat for Devs”
🚀 Concept
A backend system that powers a voice-controlled, real-time assistant for developers. It listens to voice commands (like “generate a Spring Boot REST controller for users”), understands the developer's current context (project structure, programming language), and responds with generated code snippets, explanations, or API scaffolding.

It’s like combining ChatGPT + Speech-to-Text + Dev tooling in a developer backend.

🌟 Why It’s Unique
Combines speech recognition, NLP, and code generation.

Targets a real dev pain point: context-aware assistance.

Backend is doing heavy lifting—parsing project state, integrating with local git, generating code, returning structured responses.

You can demo it with a lightweight frontend or CLI (bonus).

🛠️ Tech Stack
Java (Spring Boot) – REST API and business logic

WebSocket / SSE – Real-time updates

Whisper / Google STT – Voice to text (integrate with API)

OpenAI / LLM API – For understanding and generating code

File System Access (Java NIO) – To read local project structure

MongoDB / PostgreSQL – Save user prompts and responses

Optional: Integrate Git via JGit

📦 Core Features
🎙️ Voice Input API — Receives voice, converts to text

📚 Project Scanner — Parses current code/project structure

🧠 Prompt Engine — Combines voice input + context and sends to LLM

🏗️ Code Generator API — Sends back code snippet, explanation

📤 Live Feedback — Uses SSE or WebSocket for real-time response

🎯 Example Use Cases
“Create a Java class that connects to Redis and fetches keys.”

“Generate a REST endpoint to update user info.”

“Explain this error in my code.” (attach error message)

💡 Bonus Ideas
Save prompt history per project.

Allow plugins: GitHub integration, VSCode extension backend.

Gamify usage: “Streaks” for learning new APIs every day.

✅ What Makes it Impressive?
🔥 Relevant: AI + dev productivity = hot topic.

💡 Innovative: Not just CRUD, but context-aware intelligence.

💪 Technically rich: Speech, NLP, file parsing, real-time API.

📏 Scope controlled: You focus on backend APIs, others can be mocked.
